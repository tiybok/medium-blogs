The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.</p><p name="1cf5" id="1cf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clouds may be limited to a single organisation (enterprise clouds), or be available to many organizations (public cloud).</p><p name="f20d" id="f20d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.</p><p name="8df8" id="8df8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">burst computing</strong> capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.</p><p name="3c5b" id="3c5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cloud providers typically use a “pay-as-you-go” model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.</p><figure name="c274" id="c274" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*kZvaKpoqO2zRLkQ7nLfjig.png" data-width="270" data-height="186" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kZvaKpoqO2zRLkQ7nLfjig.png"></figure><p name="4752" id="4752" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing. By 2019, Linux was the most widely used operating system, including in Microsoft’s offerings and is thus described as dominant. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) will screen, keep up and gather data about the firewalls, intrusion identification or/and counteractive action frameworks and information stream inside the network.</p><figure name="d0bb" id="d0bb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*mzZCQ9JRy1-BpOPbF_NzGQ.png" data-width="366" data-height="138" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mzZCQ9JRy1-BpOPbF_NzGQ.png"></figure><h3 name="8324" id="8324" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">What Is Amazon Web Services?</h3><p name="011f" id="011f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers — including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies — are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.</p><p name="2173" id="2173" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a versatile, secure and reliable cloud service provider and is the most sort after Cloud Computing and Hard skill in the market. Companies have invested billions of dollars in this service provider and the number shows an upward trend in the near future. The major reason why see this the market reach of Amazon Web Services, the quality of services and support it provides and the benefits it offers.</p><h3 name="c3de" id="c3de" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Benefits of Amazon Web Services</h3><h4 name="bad7" id="bad7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">1.

The city’s IT department faced a mayoral directive to strengthen citywide cybersecurity, which is no small task given that the Los Angeles government consists of more than 40 agencies, each of which was using different security tools in managing its own IT infrastructure. The only way to view the citywide security environment was by manually correlating logs from each agency, leaving the city in a reactive rather than proactive security posture against the more than 100 million unauthorized entry attempts on its network each month.</p><p name="eb86" id="eb86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The City of Los Angeles required a flexible, scalable security information and event management (SIEM) solution to help secure the city’s digital assets and infrastructure with real-time intelligence regarding cyber threats, but without the high operational costs of on-premises deployments.</p><h3 name="a822" id="a822" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why Amazon Web Services ?</h3><figure name="3186" id="3186" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6vNQ2G5cK0hgGqV2at-oOg.png" data-width="2593" data-height="1343" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6vNQ2G5cK0hgGqV2at-oOg.png"></figure><p name="5246" id="5246" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To meet the needs of customers like the City of Los Angeles, Splunk had released Splunk Cloud, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that offers the machine-data consumption and analytic capabilities of Splunk Enterprise and is available on and powered by AWS. With Splunk Cloud, enterprises can search, analyze, and visualize their machine data in real time, gaining previously unavailable insights and actionable information, all while taking advantage of the flexibility and cost savings of the AWS Cloud.</p><p name="dfc6" id="dfc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Building Splunk Cloud on AWS was a natural step because AWS and Splunk have been strategic partners ever since Splunk first joined the AWS Partner Network (APN) in 2012. Since then, Splunk has become an APN Advanced Technology Partner, an AWS GovCloud Skills Partner, an AWS Marketplace Seller, and a member of the AWS Public Sector Partner Program with AWS Competency certifications in Big Data, DevOps, Security, IoT, and Education Technology.</p><p name="a54e" id="a54e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By deploying an SIEM solution based on Splunk Cloud, Splunk Enterprise Security, and AWS, the City of Los Angeles gained holistic, real-time views of all aspects of its security environment, whether in the cloud or on-premises. Each day, the Splunk solution encrypts, compresses, and then pulls 240 million structured and unstructured records from sources such as firewall logs, intrusion detection systems, switches and routers, external threat intelligence feeds, and the city’s threat analytics platform. Splunk Cloud normalizes the data and then returns it to the city’s security operations center, where it can be analyzed and visualized in prebuilt, easily customizable Splunk Enterprise Security dashboards.</p><p name="478c" id="478c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The solution also supports alerting, forensic investigations, and information sharing with outside agencies such as the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

They introduce new, diverse, and sizable workloads onto AWS and need to ensure security, visibility and operational intelligence are consistent with or better than their previous on-premises experiences. This customer consideration has been the cornerstone of Splunk solution development on AWS, as demonstrated in customer case studies like Autodesk and EnerNOC. Strong collaboration between the product teams has also been essential for us. Splunk often participates in AWS’s early release and Beta programs to help ensure our customers’ needs are getting visibility as new services from AWS are introduced. Splunk’s own value of “Passionate” has a beautiful synergy with the customer obsession we see at AWS, as we embrace customer requirements and challenges to deliver a best in class solution. Most recently, our collaboration manifested in Splunk being the launch APN partner for AWS Personal Health Dashboard. Splunk was the sole APN Partner fully integrated with the AWS Personal Health Dashboard at launch!</p><p name="62e7" id="62e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Splunk’s own journey to the AWS Cloud is the epitome of invention and simplification, and combined with our own company value of “Innovative”, we were able to quickly launch Splunk Cloud, a global SaaS offering for machine-data analytics powered by AWS. Splunk has since become an “all-in” AWS customer and is supported by the AWS Partner Network, Sales, Solution Architects, Professional Services, and Executives. AWS also promotes APN Partner invention through a full range of AWS acceleration programs via the AWS Partner Network (APN). These programs help Splunk to quickly and cost-effectively develop new AWS-focused solutions for our customers on AWS. Customers benefit from a simplified process of gaining global insights from their AWS-generated data.</p><h3 name="74a6" id="74a6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong
