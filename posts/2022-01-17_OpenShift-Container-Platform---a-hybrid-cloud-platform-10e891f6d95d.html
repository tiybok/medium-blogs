Also known as Red Hat OpenShift, and previously known as Open Hat Origin, this software is part of a family of containerization software, with the OpenShift Container Platform leading the way as the flagship software.</p><p name="f528" id="f528" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deeply explored, OpenShift is a cloud-based platform that operates as a PaaS (platform as a service). OpenShift excels at providing consistent security, centralized policy management, built-in monitoring, and added compatibility features. Developers use it to create, test, and deploy applications featured on the cloud.</p><p name="de4a" id="de4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OpenShift ships with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is Red Hat’s open-source operating system. This OS is the most popular enterprise Linux platform. It is also worth noting that OpenShift supports a host of programming languages such as Ruby, Java, PHP, Go, and Python.</p><h3 name="dcfd" id="dcfd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why Use OpenShift?</h3><p name="94b7" id="94b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">OpenShift provides a common platform for enterprise units to host their applications on cloud without worrying about the underlying operating system. This makes it very easy to use, develop, and deploy applications on cloud. One of the key features is, it provides managed hardware and network resources for all kinds of development and testing. With OpenShift, PaaS developer has the freedom to design their required environment with specifications.</p><figure name="29ec" id="29ec" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*Yv93QWYF-T8wD3ki" data-width="423" data-height="472" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Yv93QWYF-T8wD3ki"></figure><p name="1949" id="1949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Unlike most propriety options, open source platforms like OpenShift have advantageous developer/user communities that can typically assist in quicker bug fixes and increase functionality. OpenShift also combats many of the challenges that containerization can orchestrate, including:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="6863" id="6863" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Difficulty deploying containers across various frameworks, languages, or databases</li><li name="cc24" id="cc24" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Issues with ramping container resource usage up and down in response to container use</li><li name="a3cf" id="a3cf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Issues with tracking dependencies</li><li name="64a6" id="64a6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Difficulty tracking and monitoring container deployment on a systemic level to avoid bottlenecks and maximize productivity</li><li name="4ae8" id="4ae8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Excessive time required to manage overall container usage across your system architecture</li><li name="e4d4" id="e4d4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Difficulty and time involved in provisioning containers and performing health management checks</li><li name="93e4" id="93e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Issues with scaling applications</li><li name="caaa" id="caaa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Inability to run both stateful applications and cloud-native stateless applications simultaneously</li><li name="4b8f" id="4b8f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Excessively complicated container provisioning procedures</li></ul><p name="a88b" id="a88b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">OpenShift allows you to address the above issues by using an open-source architecture that enables you to run applications across physical, virtual, public, private, or hybrid cloud infrastructure. Any applications originating on OpenShift can run on any environment supporting Docker-formatted containers.</p><p name="dc4c" id="dc4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The platform features a robust set of command-line functionality tools as well as a multidevice web console, facilitating container orchestration across the entirety of your environment. Rapid scalability involving hundreds of instances across thousands of nodes — along with automated application builds and container health management — is also supported.</p><h3 name="6678" id="6678" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">OpenShift Features:</h3><figure name="dba5" id="dba5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*EyaqOFol4Kk1g_Cb" data-width="661" data-height="266" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EyaqOFol4Kk1g_Cb"></figure><p name="cc2e" id="cc2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There are multiple features supported by OpenShift.

Now, developers are free from spending excessive time managing and deploying containers. This helps them to speed up the development process and get the product faster in the market.</li><li name="601d" id="601d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Accelerate application development:</em></strong> Deploying and managing containers at a scale is a complicated process.

This improves the companies productivity and speeds up application development.</li><li name="e2a0" id="e2a0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Enterprise-grade, container-based platform with no vendor lock :</em> </strong>Consider the case of a company with worldwide manufacturing facilities that implement a container platform tool. If the company shifts its production approach to a process that requires it to change to a new operating system — one that isn’t supported by its containerization platform — the company will face the expensive task of redoing its containerization orchestration on another platform.With a vendor-agnostic open-source platform, users can migrate their container processes to the new operating system quickly — while avoiding the extensive costs often involved in migrating from a proprietary operating framework.</li><li name="4ce1" id="4ce1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Self-service provisioning</em></strong> :This self-service provisioning helps improve developer productivity by allowing your development team to work with the tools they are most comfortable using — speeding up the development process by enabling faster creation and deployment of applications. At the same time, OpenShift allows your operations staff to retain control over the environment as a whole.</li></ul><h3 name="68e0" id="68e0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">OpenShift vs Kubernetes</h3><p name="e4ba" id="e4ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Both Kubernetes and OpenShift feature robust and scalable architecture that enables rapid and large-scale application development, deployment, and management. They both run on the Apache License 2.0.</p><p name="e3cc" id="e3cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that’s about where the similarities end. Here are just a few of the differences between OpenShift vs Kubernetes.</p><h4 name="5d70" id="5d70" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Deployment</h4><p name="d068" id="d068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes offers more flexibility as an open-source framework and can be installed on almost any platform — like <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/azure-tutorial/what-is-azure" data-href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/azure-tutorial/what-is-azure" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Microsoft Azure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a> and AWS — as well as any Linux distribution, including Ubuntu and Debian. OpenShift, on the other hand, requires Red Hat’s proprietary Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host (RHELAH), Fedora, or CentOS. This narrows options for many businesses, especially if they’re not already using these platforms.</p><h4 name="d5e5" id="d5e5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Security</h4><p name="474c" id="474c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">OpenShift has stricter security policies. For instance, it is forbidden to run a container as root. It also offers a secure-by-default option to enhance security. Kubernetes doesn’t come with built-in authentication or authorization capabilities, so developers must create bearer tokens and other authentication procedures manually.</p><h4 name="84bb" id="84bb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Support</h4><p name="7f46" id="7f46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes has a large active community of developers who continuously collaborate on refining the platform. It also offers support for multiple frameworks and languages. OpenShift has a much smaller support community that is limited primarily to Red Hat developers.</p><h4 name="a086" id="a086" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Releases and Updates</h4><p name="0ae5" id="0ae5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes has an average of four releases each year, while OpenShift trails with around three. Similarly, Kubernetes supports several concurrent and simultaneous updates, while OpenShift DeploymentConfig does not.</p><h4 name="8374" id="8374" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Networking</h4><p name="ae30" id="ae30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes lacks a networking solution but lets users employ third-party network plug-ins. OpenShift, on the other hand, has its out-of-the-box networking solution called <a href="https://www.openvswitch.org/" data-href="https://www.openvswitch.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Open vSwitch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open vSwitch</a>, which comes with three native plug-ins.</p><h4 name="ab00" id="ab00" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Templates</h4><p name="ed17" id="ed17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes offers Helm templates that are easy to use and provide a generous amount of flexibility. OpenShift templates are nowhere near as flexible or user-friendly.</p><h4 name="d102" id="d102" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Image Registry Management</h4><p name="c772" id="c772" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes doesn’t have an integrated image registry, although it allows you to pull images from a private registry so you can create your own pods. Additionally, you can make your own Docker registry.</p><p name="8409" id="8409" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OpenShift, on the other hand, has an in-built image registry and pairs seamlessly with DockerHub or Red Hat. Therefore, developers can use image streams to effortlessly search for and manage container <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/docker-tutorial/docker-images" data-href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/docker-tutorial/docker-images" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="images." rel="noopener" target="_blank">images.</a></p><h4 name="09be" id="09be" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Integrated CI/CD</h4><p name="8669" id="8669" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes doesn’t provide a complete out-of-the-box <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/best-ci-cd-tools-article" data-href="https://www.simplilearn.com/best-ci-cd-tools-article" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="CI/CD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CI/CD</a> solution. However, you can create an entire CI/CD pipeline by pairing Kubernetes with tools such as automated monitoring, testing, and CI servers. Also, third party plugins such as CircleCI can help you seamlessly build faster CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes.</p><p name="850d" id="850d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like Kubernetes, OpenShift doesn’t offer a complete CI/CD solution, but it has a certified <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-jenkins-x-article" data-href="https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-jenkins-x-article" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Jenkins container" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jenkins container</a> that functions as a Continuous Integration server.</p><h4 name="03cd" id="03cd" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">User Experience and Interface</h4><p name="9eba" id="9eba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Kubernetes contains a complex web interface that may potentially befuddle newbies. Users who want to access the Kubernetes web graphics user interface (GUI) must install the Kubernetes dashboard and use kube-proxy to send their machine’s port to the cluster server. Users also must create bearer tokens to make authentication and authorization easier, since the dashboard doesn’t have a login page.</p><p name="5098" id="5098" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OpenShift, conversely, features an intuitive web console which includes a one-touch login page. The console offers a simple, form-based interface, allowing users to add, delete, and modify resources. OpenShift has the distinct user advantage</p><h3 name="cc7c" id="cc7c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Companies Using Openshift:</h3><h3 name="6228" id="6228" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Ford</h3><figure name="6f2c" id="6f2c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*jxXaPD9xliNj32ZL" data-width="1400" data-height="875" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*jxXaPD9xliNj32ZL"></figure><p name="3889" id="3889" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Ford Motor Company is a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan.

Digital Service Powering functionalities of BMW automobiles were showcased at RedHat Summit. ConnectedDrive system functionalities have been in the market for 20 years, but it requires a more advanced technology-driven delivery system to deliver applications. Therefore in the year 2016, BMW started migrating its full application suite to OpenShift. Now BMW supports more than 1000 web applications for their customers, automobiles, production and sales process etc. This case study states the OpenShift use cases.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="6f2f" id="6f2f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Challenge:</strong> BMW wanted to gain high-performance big data capabilities and a data-driven platform.</li><li name="bef3" id="bef3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Solution Implemented:</strong> DXC Technology was chosen by the BMW Group to develop a solution for its data and performance concerns. DXC Technology used DXC Robotic Drive, a managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) based on Red Hat OpenShift and other Red Hat technology, to build a Kubernetes-based platform with extensive automation capabilities. With scalable machine learning and big data processing capabilities, this technology aids the BMW Group in developing faster.</li><li name="0a04" id="0a04" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Result:</strong> The BMW Group dramatically cut development time and increased developer productivity by automating repeated operations and giving self-service capabilities. Data gathering, processing, and storage capabilities are also massively scalable on the platform. It has over 230 PB of usable storage and enough processing capacity to simulate 240 million kilometres of test data.</li></ul><h3 name="c1c6" id="c1c6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Summary :</h3><p name="610e" id="610e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">OpenShift helps you to develop, deploy, and manage container-based applications. It provides you with a self-service platform to create, modify, and deploy applications on demand, thus enabling faster development and release life cycles.Both Kubernetes and OpenShift are popular container management systems, and each has its unique features and benefits. While Kubernetes helps automate application deployment, scaling, and operations, OpenShift is the container platform that works with Kubernetes to help applications run more efficiently.</p></div></div></section>
