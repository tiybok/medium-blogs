Jenkins supports the complete development life cycle of software from building, testing, documenting the software, deploying, and other stages of the software development life cycle.</p><p name="7038" id="7038" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jenkins is a widely used application around the world that has around 300k installations and growing day by day. By using Jenkins, software companies can accelerate their software development process, as Jenkins can automate build and test at a rapid rate.</p><p name="24cf" id="24cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a server-based application and requires a web server like Apache Tomcat. The reason Jenkins software became so popular is that of its monitoring of repeated tasks which arise during the development of a project. For example, if your team is developing a project, Jenkins will continuously test your project builds and show you the errors in early stages of your development.</p><h3 name="ba62" id="ba62" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">History Of Jenkins</h3><p name="01c4" id="01c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Jenkins has an early mover advantage since it has been in development since 2011. Kohsuke Kawaguchi created Jenkins (then called ‘Hudson’) while working at Sun Microsystems. Hudson was created in the summer of 2004 and the first release was in February 2005.</p><p name="2218" id="2218" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle, a proposal was approved by the Hudson community for creating the Jenkins project. In February 2011, Oracle intended that the development of Hudson should continue hence, Hudson was forked instead of renaming it to Jenkins.</p><p name="aad8" id="aad8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though Hudson and Jenkins were being developed independently, Jenkins acquired significantly more projects &amp; contributors than Hudson. Consequently, Hudson is no longer maintained by the community.</p><h3 name="6842" id="6842" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Jenkins Features</h3><p name="cb3c" id="cb3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The following are some facts about Jenkins that makes it better than other Continuous Integration tools:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="bb9a" id="bb9a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Adoption:</strong> Jenkins is widespread, with more than 147,000 active installations and over 1 million users around the world.</li><li name="9fd5" id="9fd5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Plugins:</strong> Jenkins is interconnected with well over 1,000 plugins that allow it to integrate with most of the development, testing and deployment tools.</li></ul><p name="07a0" id="07a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It is evident from the above points that Jenkins has a very high demand globally.</p><p name="583a" id="583a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before we dive into Jenkins it is important to know what is Continuous Integration (CI) and why it was introduced.</p><h3 name="21e7" id="21e7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Before we can talk about why to use CI/CD, let’s discuss what CI and CD are:</h3><p name="64b8" id="64b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">CI </strong>is a development practice that ensures each new proposed change does not break existing functionality. It works by monitoring a version control system (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.) on an ongoing basis, with code being tested using a continuous integration tool each time so that no errors are merged to the codebase. This means a better experience for both developers and users of the product by making sure that errors don’t make it to production. In addition, ongoing testing allows remote workers to contribute worry-free to a shared repository from wherever they are located.</p><p name="5ad3" id="5ad3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">CD </strong>is a development practice that reduces the work required to deploy new code. Code is tested in production-like environments on an ongoing basis, working in short sprints to make it easier to identify and fix bugs as they come up. When developers are ready to deploy code, it can be done with the push of a button.</p><h3 name="4519" id="4519" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why is CI/CD important?</h3><p name="6b29" id="6b29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">CI/CD is a key component of the DevOps culture that exists in many successful technology organizations, most notably places like Amazon, HP, and Netflix. Having a strong DevOps culture means that the engineering and operations teams communicate more often and more efficiently, and work collaboratively to ensure the best experience for everyone.</p><h3 name="efd0" id="efd0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Jenkins Features</h3><p name="f675" id="f675" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The following are some facts about Jenkins that makes it better than other Continuous Integration tools:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="d718" id="d718" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Adoption:</strong> Jenkins is widespread, with more than 147,000 active installations and over 1 million users around the world.</li><li name="578c" id="578c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Plugins:</strong> Jenkins is interconnected with well over 1,000 plugins that allow it to integrate with most of the development, testing and deployment tools.</li></ul><p name="64a1" id="64a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It is evident from the above points that Jenkins has a very high demand globally.</p><p name="3410" id="3410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before we dive into Jenkins it is important to know what is Continuous Integration and why it was introduced.</p><figure name="67cb" id="67cb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*h_Hi_yDgyRanwIZiwTGjkw.jpeg" data-width="800" data-height="310" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*h_Hi_yDgyRanwIZiwTGjkw.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="34f1" id="34f1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Features of Jenkins</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="d7fb" id="d7fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery : As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.</li><li name="8111" id="8111" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Easy installation : Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Linux, macOS and other Unix-like operating systems.</li><li name="dda4" id="dda4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Easy configuration : Jenkins can be easily set up and configured via its web interface, which includes on-the-fly error checks and built-in help.</li><li name="9eeb" id="9eeb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Plugins : With hundreds of plugins in the Update Center, Jenkins integrates with practically every tool in the continuous integration and continuous delivery toolchain.</li><li name="4438" id="4438" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Extensible : Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture, providing nearly infinite possibilities for what Jenkins can do.</li><li name="5c04" id="5c04" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Distributed : Jenkins can easily distribute work across multiple machines, helping drive builds, tests and deployments across multiple platforms faster.</li></ul><h3 name="215b" id="215b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Advantages of using Jenkins</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="df95" id="df95" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">Jenkins is being managed by the community which is very open. Every month, they hold public meetings and take inputs from the public for the development of Jenkins project.</li><li name="4cd2" id="4cd2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">So far around 280 tickets are closed, and the project publishes stable release every three months.</li><li name="e0fb" id="e0fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">As technology grows, so does Jenkins. So far Jenkins has around 320 plugins published in its plugins database. With plugins, Jenkins becomes even more powerful and feature rich.</li><li name="3bfa" id="3bfa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Jenkins tool also supports cloud-based architecture so that you can deploy Jenkins in cloud-based platforms.</li><li name="f676" id="f676" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The reason why Jenkins became popular is that it was created by a developer for developers.</li></ul><h3 name="4f7c" id="4f7c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Disadvantages of using Jenkins</h3><p name="c6ab" id="c6ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Though Jenkins is a very powerful tool, it has its flaws.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="3d4a" id="3d4a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Its interface is out dated and not user friendly compared to current UI trends.</li><li name="cc7f" id="cc7f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Though Jenkins is loved by many developers, it’s not that easy to maintain it because Jenkins runs on a server and requires some skills as server administrator to monitor its activity.</li><li name="e8be" id="e8be" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">One of the reasons why many people don’t implement Jenkins is due to its difficulty in installing and configuring Jenkins.</li><li name="0086" id="0086" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Continuous integrations regularly break due to some small setting changes. Continuous integration will be paused and therefore requires some developer attention.</li></ul><figure name="ad08" id="ad08" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*am9ljTpmmY7GgMNtyJI78A.png" data-width="1382" data-height="782" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*am9ljTpmmY7GgMNtyJI78A.png"></figure><h3 name="21ec" id="21ec" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Jenkins Use Cases</h3><p name="eca3" id="eca3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let’s take a look at some of the main scenarios Jenkins plays a critical part in.</p><h4 name="1aa0" id="1aa0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Continuous Integration (CI)</h4><p name="a956" id="a956" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Continuous integration is a practice that forces developers to frequently integrate their code into a central repository. Instead of building out new features to the end without any quality measurement, every change is tested against the central repository in order to anticipate errors.</p><p name="2fb4" id="2fb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every developer commits daily to a shared mainline and every commit triggers an automated process to build and test. If building or testing fails it can be detected and fixed within minutes without compromising the whole structure, workflow, and project. In that way, it is possible to isolate problems, solving them faster and provide higher-quality products.</p><h4 name="9b0e" id="9b0e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Continuous Delivery (CD)</h4><p name="696c" id="696c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Continuous delivery is the ability to make changes of all types — such as new features, configuration changes, error fixes, experiments — into production in a safe and efficient manner using short work cycles.</p><p name="1931" id="1931" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main goal in continuous delivery is to make deployments predictable as routine activities that can be achieved upon request. To be successful, the code needs to always be in a deployable state even when there is a scenario with lots of developers working and making changes on a daily basis. All of the code progress and changes are delivered in a nonstop way with high quality and low risks. The end result is one or more artifacts that can be deployed to production.</p><h4 name="5731" id="5731" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Continuous Deployment (CD)</h4><p name="f411" id="f411" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Continuous deployment, also known as continuous implementation, is an advanced stage of continuous delivery that the automation process does not end at the delivery stage. In this methodology, every change that is validated at the automatic testing stage is later implemented at the production stage.</p><p name="a8cd" id="a8cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">fail fast</em> strategy is always of the utmost importance when deploying to production. Since every change is deployed to production, it is possible to identify edge cases and unexpected behaviors that would be very hard to identify with automated tests. To fully take advantage of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">continuous deployment</em>, it is important to have solid logging technology that allows you to identify the increasing error count on newer versions. In addition, a trustworthy orchestration technology like<a href="https://kubernetes.io/" data-href="https://kubernetes.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> Kubernetes</a> that will allow the new version to slowly be deployed to users until the full rollout or an incident is detected and the version is canceled.</p><h4 name="3cad" id="3cad" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Automation</h4><p name="e9d1" id="e9d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As a job executor, Jenkins can be used to automate repetitive tasks like backup/restore databases, turn on or turn off machines, collect statistics about a service and other tasks. Since every job can be scheduled, repetitive tasks can have a desired time interval (like once a day, once a week, every fifth day of the month, and so forth).</p><h3 name="e76a" id="e76a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Jenkins Pipeline :</h3><figure name="49d3" id="49d3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*gmEdLfK9CSWDXvxC.png" data-width="696" data-height="238" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gmEdLfK9CSWDXvxC.png"></figure><p name="6b22" id="6b22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A Jenkins pipeline is a combination of jobs, tasks, or events that are connected to each other in a sequence. In other words, it is a group of plugins that enable continuous delivery pipelines to be easily integrated and implemented. Extendable automation works to support a pipeline in the creation of both complex and simple delivery pipelines in the form of code and with the help of domain-specific language or DSL.</p><h3 name="28f1" id="28f1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Companies using Jenkins :</h3><p name="6dcb" id="6dcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We have data on 59,079 companies that use Jenkins. The companies using Jenkins are most often found in United States and in the Computer Software industry. Jenkins is most often used by companies with 10–50 employees and 1M-10M dollars in revenue. Our data for Jenkins usage goes back as far as 5 years and 1 months.</p><figure name="14b6" id="14b6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*MMNig3hxWkBAqdTgK5y7ig.png" data-width="1457" data-height="1674" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MMNig3hxWkBAqdTgK5y7ig.png"></figure><figure name="0012" id="0012" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*NdIyAZgFGl_sOb7rpLDk8w.png" data-width="1282" data-height="693" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NdIyAZgFGl_sOb7rpLDk8w.png"></figure><h3 name="bae3" id="bae3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Conclusion:</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="82fa" id="82fa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">In Continuous Integration, after a code commit, the software is built and tested immediately</li><li name="3853" id="3853" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Jenkins used for orchestrating a chain of actions for Continuous Integration in a software project</li><li name="1e8e" id="1e8e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Before Jenkins when all Developers had completed their assigned coding tasks, they used to commit their code all at same time.
