(Artificial Intelligence) ?</h3><figure name="5e84" id="5e84" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*kwDjo9lYAOxDkDBAiHEtyQ.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kwDjo9lYAOxDkDBAiHEtyQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="0193" id="0193" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.</p><p name="a81d" id="a81d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data.</p><h3 name="4b54" id="4b54" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How does AI work?</h3><p name="91c7" id="91c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Can machines think?</em>”</p><p name="2ddc" id="2ddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Turing’s paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”(1950), and it’s subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.</p><p name="117a" id="117a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At its core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing’s question in the affirmative.</p><p name="ccf0" id="ccf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In their groundbreaking textbook <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</em>, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question</p><h3 name="44b1" id="44b1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why Is AI Important?</h3><p name="ecca" id="ecca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">AI technology is important because it enables human capabilities, understanding, reasoning, planning, communication and perception to be undertaken by software increasingly effectively, efficiently and at low cost.General analytical tasks, including finding patterns in data, that have been performed by software for many years can also be performed more effectively using AI.The automation of these abilities creates new opportunities in most business sectors and consumer applications.Significant new products, services and capabilities enabled by AI include autonomous vehicles, automated medical diagnosis, voice input for human-computer interaction, intelligent agents, automated data synthesis and enhanced decision-making.AI has numerous, tangible use cases today that are enabling corporate revenue growth and cost savings in existing sectors.Applications will be most numerous in sectors in which a large proportion of time is spent collecting and synthesising data: financial services, retail and trade, professional services, manufacturing and healthcare. Applications of AI-powered computer vision will be particularly significant in the transport sector.</p><h3 name="9a5c" id="9a5c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What is Machine Learning?</h3><figure name="90fb" id="90fb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*xnd960WY7nhheln6UAW4MQ.jpeg" data-width="900" data-height="468" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xnd960WY7nhheln6UAW4MQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="ceb8" id="ceb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.Recommendation engines are a common use case for machine learning. Other popular uses include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection, business process automation (BPA) and predictive maintenance.</p><h4 name="aaa8" id="aaa8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Why Is Machine Learning Important?</h4><p name="1d3a" id="1d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today’s leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.</p><h3 name="e59f" id="e59f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Is Deep learning?</h3><figure name="b301" id="b301" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*GV-b_7WuxvnCpUqE7E38xA.png" data-width="1254" data-height="732" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GV-b_7WuxvnCpUqE7E38xA.png"></figure><p name="ddc4" id="ddc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.</p><p name="f511" id="f511" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.</p><h4 name="f6a0" id="f6a0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Why is Deep Learning Important?</h4><p name="4dc3" id="4dc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The ability to process large numbers of features makes deep learning very powerful when dealing with unstructured data. However, deep learning algorithms can be overkill for less complex problems because they require access to a vast amount of data to be effective. For instance, ImageNet, the common benchmark for training deep learning models for comprehensive image recognition, has access to over 14 million images.</p><p name="fd03" id="fd03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the data is too simple or incomplete, it is very easy for a deep learning model to become overfitted and fail to generalize well to new data. As a result, deep learning models are not as effective as other techniques (such as boosted decision trees or linear models) for most practical business problems such as understanding customer churn, detecting fraudulent transactions and other cases with smaller datasets and fewer features. In certain cases like multiclass classification, deep learning can work for smaller, structured datasets.</p><h3 name="827c" id="827c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Relation between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3><figure name="7cef" id="7cef" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LLeTiQdj11P5GKGO1szcVg.png" data-width="974" data-height="844" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LLeTiQdj11P5GKGO1szcVg.png"></figure><blockquote name="8929" id="8929" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--figure"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">T</em>hus, we understand that AI is an umbrella discipline that covers everything related to making machines smarter. Machine Learning (ML) is commonly used along with AI but it is a subset of AI. ML refers to an AI system that can self-learn based on the algorithm. Deep Learning (DL) is machine learning (ML) applied to large data sets.</blockquote><p name="50cd" id="50cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Some sectors are at the start of their AI Journey, others are veteran travelers. Both have a long way to go. Regardless, the impact Artificial Intelligence is having on our present day lives is hard to ignore:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="6645" id="6645" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Transportation:</strong> Although it could take a decade or more to perfect them, autonomous cars will one day ferry us from place to place.</li><li name="2252" id="2252" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Manufacturing: </strong>AI powered robots work alongside humans to perform a limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly.</li><li name="39da" id="39da" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Healthcare:</strong> In the comparatively AI-nascent field of healthcare, diseases are more quickly and accurately diagnosed, drug discovery is sped up and streamlined, virtual nursing assistants monitor patients and big data analysis helps to create a more personalized patient experience.</li><li name="5b3e" id="5b3e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Education:</strong> Textbooks are digitized with the help of AI, early-stage virtual tutors assist human instructors and facial analysis gauges the emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored and better tailor the experience to their individual needs.</li><li name="d491" id="d491" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Media:</strong> Journalism is harnessing AI, too, and will continue to benefit from it. Bloomberg uses Cyborg technology to help make quick sense of complex financial reports. The Associated Press employs the natural language abilities of Automated Insights to produce 3,700 earning reports stories per year nearly four times more than in the recent past.</li><li name="5921" id="5921" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Intelligent Cybersecurity : </strong>In regard to cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence is making great strides.

So it’s no surprise that Facebook is investing in AI. Facebook’s AI research group, known as FAIR, says it is committed to advancing the field of machine intelligence and developing new technologies to provide people with better ways to communicate. Mark Zuckerberg and Co. worked on a negotiation platform with two AIs called Alice and Bob, among other things, but ended the project after the couple began communicating in their secret language.</p><figure name="c478" id="c478" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DzFDHeEhurgft_-0lMOHtQ.png" data-width="510" data-height="200" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DzFDHeEhurgft_-0lMOHtQ.png"></figure><p name="c310" id="c310" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Google : </strong>Perhaps the largest and most important AI company on this list is also the most obvious. Google has acquired AI start-ups as if there were going to be no more soon. Over the past four years, Mountain View has created no fewer than twelve new artificial intelligence companies. The most important purchase was the $400 million deal for DeepMind, the board game playing Go champion. There is also Google’s machine system TensorFlow, which is now free for all, and the ongoing Tensor AI chip project for machine learning on the device. Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, has already mentioned that in the long run we are “evolving from a ‘mobile first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world in the computer industry,” and that already says everything you need to know to see where Google sees the future.</p><figure name="c6d0" id="c6d0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bGi37azyBsUBETD2t3lAJQ.png" data-width="225" data-height="225" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bGi37azyBsUBETD2t3lAJQ.png"></figure><p name="cba8" id="cba8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">IBM : </strong>The multinational technology company IBM has been active in AI since the 1950s.
