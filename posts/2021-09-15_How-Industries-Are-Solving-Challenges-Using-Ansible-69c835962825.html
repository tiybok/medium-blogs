All of these very repetitive tasks involve the execution of hundreds of commands on hundreds of different servers. Smart people develop a script to automate these tasks but it requires coding skills and regular maintenance of this script and a lot of time to put this script together in the first place. That’s where Ansible comes in the picture.</p><h3 name="3e73" id="3e73" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why to use Ansible ?</h3><p name="1cbf" id="1cbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intra service orchestration, and provisioning. Automation is crucial these days, with IT environments that are too complex and often need to scale too quickly for system administrators and developers to keep up if they had to do everything manually.</p><p name="007a" id="007a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Automation simplifies complex tasks, not just making developers’ jobs more manageable but allowing them to focus attention on other tasks that add value to an organization. In other words, it frees up time and increases efficiency. And Ansible, as noted above, is rapidly rising to the top in the world of automation tools. Automation tools profit the IT industry a lot because it Saves more time , Is cost efficient in terms of resources and money and Enhances quality of products</p><h3 name="0ab8" id="0ab8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Some of the terminology used in Ansible</strong></h3><ul class="postList"><li name="a8cb" id="a8cb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Controller Node:</strong> Machine where Ansible is installed.</li><li name="7073" id="7073" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Managed Node:</strong> Managed nodes are also sometimes called hosts.</li><li name="0b7f" id="0b7f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Inventory:</strong> Information regarding servers to be managed</li><li name="8167" id="8167" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Playbook:</strong> Automation script is defined using tasks defined in YAML format</li><li name="0b37" id="0b37" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Task:</strong> Procedure to be executed</li><li name="ab59" id="ab59" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Module: </strong>Predefined commands executed directly on remote hosts.</li></ul><h3 name="2e3d" id="2e3d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Features of Ansible</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="a2c5" id="a2c5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Free</strong>: Ansible is an open-source tool.</li><li name="f4d6" id="f4d6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Very simple to set up and use:</strong> No special coding skills are necessary to use Ansible’s playbooks (more on playbooks later).</li><li name="814a" id="814a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Powerful:</strong> Ansible lets you model even highly complex IT workflows.</li><li name="c0e5" id="c0e5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Flexible:</strong> You can orchestrate the entire application environment no matter where it’s deployed. You can also customize it based on your needs.</li><li name="55f2" id="55f2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Agentless:</strong> You don’t need to install any other software or firewall ports on the client systems you want to automate. You also don’t have to set up a separate management structure.</li><li name="3d1a" id="3d1a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Efficient:</strong> Because you don’t need to install any extra software, there’s more room for application resources on your server.</li></ul><h3 name="1fc5" id="1fc5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Benefits of Ansible</h3><h4 name="5c75" id="5c75" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Simplified Automation</h4><p name="47fb" id="47fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Ansible is a simple-to-use platform, easy to install and configure, with a very fast learning rate. In less than 30 minutes, it’s possible to install and configure the system and execute ad hoc commands for servers to solve a specific problem: daylight saving time adjustments, time synchronization, root password change, updating servers, restarting services, and so on.</p><h4 name="3a7d" id="3a7d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Low Learning Curve</strong></h4><p name="fc23" id="fc23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Ansible is easy to deploy because it uses no agents or additional custom security infrastructure. It also leverages YAML, a simple language to describe your automation job via playbooks. Playbooks push the desired settings on the hosts defined in the inventory and can even be run ad hoc (via the command line, not requiring definitions in files).</p><h4 name="641b" id="641b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Automate Now</strong></h4><p name="8fb5" id="8fb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">From the moment you can ping the hosts through Ansible, you can start automating your environment. Begin with small tasks, following best practices, prioritizing tasks that add value to the business, solve major problems, and gain time and improving productivity.</p><h3 name="effe" id="effe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Ansible’s Use Cases:</h3><p name="33d0" id="33d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Ansible seamlessly unites workflow orchestration with configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in one easy-to-use and deploy platform with network and security automations.</p><h4 name="c10f" id="c10f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Configuration Management</h4><p name="d438" id="d438" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Centralizing configuration file management and deployment is a common use case for Ansible, and it is how many power users are first introduced to the Ansible automation platform.</p><h4 name="2100" id="2100" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Orchestration</h4><p name="90ea" id="90ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Configurations alone do not define your environment. You need to define how multiple configurations interact, and ensure the disparate pieces can be managed as a whole.</p><h4 name="ee30" id="ee30" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">App Deployment</h4><p name="7cd2" id="7cd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When you define your application with Ansible and manage the deployment with Red Hat Ansible Tower, teams can effectively manage the entire application life cycle from development to production.</p><h4 name="273e" id="273e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Provisioning</h4><p name="8d0f" id="8d0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Applications have to be deployed or installed on systems. Ansible and Red Hat Ansible Tower can help streamline the process of provisioning systems, whether you are PXE booting and kickstarting bare-metal servers or virtual machines, or creating virtual machines or cloud instances from templates. Applications have to be deployed or installed on systems.</p><h4 name="2194" id="2194" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Continuous Delivery</h4><p name="4f11" id="4f11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Creating a CI/CD pipeline requires coordination and buy-in from numerous teams. You cannot do it without a simple automation platform that everyone in your organization can use. Ansible Playbooks keep your applications properly deployed (and managed) throughout their entire life cycle.</p><h4 name="0aed" id="0aed" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Security and Compliance</h4><p name="03aa" id="03aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When your security policy is defined in Ansible Playbooks, scanning and remediation of sitewide security policies can be integrated into other automated processes. Instead of being an afterthought, it is an integral part of everything that is deployed.</p><h4 name="b234" id="b234" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Network Automation</h4><p name="14b4" id="14b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">First, server infrastructure. Now, network infrastructure. The benefits of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform can be extended to physical networks, software-defined networks, and cloud-based networks. Ansible Automation Platform is a single, flexible automation technology that can be used across diverse network devices and other IT domains, making it easy to automate entire network and IT processes.</p><h3 name="5c69" id="5c69" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Top Industries that using Ansible</h3><p name="d500" id="d500" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In today’s world, many Companies are solving various use-cases and challenges using this automation tool called Ansible. Some of these are:-</p><figure name="b3d3" id="b3d3" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*vhJkyBH6fuwYgyr8tHRQfA.png" data-width="1048" data-height="536" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vhJkyBH6fuwYgyr8tHRQfA.png"></figure><h3 name="98e0" id="98e0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">ASPIRENXT</h3><p name="0b8a" id="0b8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Aspire Nxt was born in 2010 to help organizations with their IT requirements. Over the years, we have lived up to our promise and at the same time grown into an organization that we are proud of. Our mission, today, is to deliver the best in the business by curating a culture of mutual success.</p><p name="41f9" id="41f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AspireNXT designs centralized patching system for multi cloud environment using Ansible.</p><p name="64c9" id="64c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of our recent clients was looking for a centralized management system for Linux and Windows servers that would allow them to update the servers remotely, push selective updates, and reboot as per their convenience.</p><p name="54b9" id="54b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution :</strong> On evaluation our team realized that the first, and probably the biggest challenge, was the issue faced by the client while upgrading and patching their existing servers. The existing system was build using a multi-cloud Environment (AWS, Google Cloud and Azure) with a mix of Windows and Linux operation systems. For each update or patch, the client would login to each server individually and run and install selective updates only post that the server would reboot automatically.</p><p name="832d" id="832d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To combat this, the team at AspireNxt suggested the use of Ansible. Ansible is an open source software that automates provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. It also connects via SSH, remote PowerShell, WinRM or via other remote API’s. Using Ansible would allow the client to automate their patching. We deployed an Ansible server for them on their AWS Cloud environment, which then connected via SSH, or Windows Remote Management Service to all the servers that required patch management.</p><p name="28b5" id="28b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally we leveraged the YAML files (or Ansible Playbooks) on the Ansible server to run the following tasks –<br>1. Check for available updates.<br>2. Fetch the list of updates from remote servers to Ansible Server in a file<br>3. View the updated list and decide on the updates necessary.<br>4. Pass the package name (or KB number) to a playbook that needs to be updated remotely.<br>5. Ask for a reboot and disable auto reboot.</p><figure name="f62f" id="f62f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*fI49kcZwj84gX_FNaT8_cw.png" data-width="3795" data-height="2000" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fI49kcZwj84gX_FNaT8_cw.png"></figure><h3 name="f3a2" id="f3a2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">CISCO</h3><p name="6ca1" id="6ca1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As customers embrace the DevOps model to accelerate application deployment and achieve higher efficiency in operating their data centers, the infrastructure needs to change and respond faster than ever to business needs. In many customer IT environments, network operations still remain entrenched in error-prone manual processes. Many of the earlier generation folks that were attracted to network operations didn’t want to be programmers, rather they were more interested in implementing and maintaining network policies using CLI and monolithic means on proprietary platforms. In recent times, best-practices in Server-side and DevOps practices have started influencing the networking world with Cloud Administrators forced to support both the compute and network resources. However, in many cases, entirely moving away from traditional network operations may not be possible, just as a 100% DevOps strategy may not be a good fit. The best strategy: The most with the least amount of change or energy. Automation is the natural solution here . It can make the most unproductive and repetitive tasks ideal candidates for automation.</p><p name="6bfa" id="6bfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Red Hat Ansible has fast emerged as one of the most popular platforms to automate these day-to-day manual tasks and bring unprecedented cost savings and operational efficiency. Cisco ACI’s Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) supports a robust and open API that Ansible can seamlessly leverage. Ansible is open source, works with many different operating systems that run on Cisco Networking platforms (ACI, IOS, NX-OS, IOS-XR), and supports the range of ACI offerings. Together, Cisco ACI and Ansible provide a perfect combination enabling customers to embrace the DevOps model and accelerate ACI Deployment, Monitoring, day-to-day management, and more.</p><p name="e47e" id="e47e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Solution :</strong> Ansible is the only solution in the market today to address network automation challenges, with its unified configuration, provisioning and application deployment, and creating favorable business outcomes like accelerated DevOps and a simplified IT environment.</p><p name="6e1f" id="6e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ansible brings lots of synergies to an ACI environment with its simple automation language, powerful features such as app-deployment, configuration. management and workflow orchestration and above all an agentless architecture that makes the execution environment predictable and secure.</p><p name="4e08" id="4e08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the latest Ansible release (2.9), there are over 100 ACI and Multisite modules in Ansible core. Modules for specific objects like, Tenant and Application Profiles as well as a module for interacting directly with the ACI REST API. This means that a broad set of ACI functionality is available as soon as you install Ansible. After installing Ansible only two things are required to start automating an ACI Network Fabric. First, an Ansible playbook, which is a set of automation instructions and two, the inventory file which lists the devices to be automated in this case an APIC. The playbooks are written in YAML to define the tasks to execute against an ACI fabric. Here is an ACI playbook sample that configures a Tenant on an APIC.</p><figure name="b4a4" id="b4a4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*g6DfhLtskWx1Io2PpwI9Qg.png" data-width="342" data-height="280" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*g6DfhLtskWx1Io2PpwI9Qg.png"></figure><h3 name="41cb" id="41cb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">NASA</h3><p name="1be1" id="1be1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Ansible Tower provided a dashboard that provided the status summary of all hosts and jobs which allowed NASA to group all contents and manage access permissions across different departments. It also helped to split up the organization by associating content and control permission for groups as well.</p><p name="79e5" id="79e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ansible Tower is a web-based interface for managing Ansible. One of the top items in Ansible users’ wishlists was an easy-to-use UI for managing quick deployments and monitoring one’s configurations. Ansible management came up with Ansible Tower in response.</p><p name="ebde" id="ebde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Further, Ansible divided the tasks among teams by assigning various roles. It managed the clean-up of old job history, activity streams, data marked for deletion and system tracking info. Refer to the diagram below to understand how Ansible has simplified the work of NASA.</p><figure name="cde5" id="cde5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KhEMHkVnXvYQvc7VLSdEYQ.png" data-width="696" data-height="236" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KhEMHkVnXvYQvc7VLSdEYQ.png"></figure><h3 name="7e1c" id="7e1c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Microsoft</h3><p name="419d" id="419d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Microsoft Corporation develops, manufactures, and supports software, consumer electronics and computers, and related services. To simplify and scale at pace with market demands, Microsoft worked with Red Hat to create a scalable, technology-agnostic automation framework to reduce manual workloads with efficient tools and processes and mitigate performance and security issues with standardized, tested code</p><p name="ac1d" id="ac1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Microsoft needed to address increasing complexity across their corporate network infrastructure , comprised of tens of thousands of endpoints , that connects Microsoft locations worldwide. Their issues were compounded as code created by development and engineering teams was not version-controlled or peer-reviewed, leading to duplication and quality issues.</p><p name="ff72" id="ff72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and working with Red Hat Consulting, Microsoft created a standardized, centralized network automation environment that reduces routine, repeatable tasks and complexity.</p><figure name="0bb5" id="0bb5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*u5shl9GXnzYNxSAe.jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="392" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*u5shl9GXnzYNxSAe.jpg"></figure><h3 name="932c" id="932c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">NetApp</h3><p name="4b33" id="4b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">NetApp got its start way back in 1992, when using the internet meant dialing up and hearing beeps, crackles, and eeps. By tech company standards we’ve seen it all, and we’ve not only survived, we’ve thrived. That’s because we’ve kept our focus on one thing the data. Continuously improving how it’s managed, stored, analyzed, protected, and moved.</p><p name="e5c2" id="e5c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Keeping up with the pace of business can bring several challenges; delivering infrastructure resources should not be one of them. When using Ansible on any NetApp platform, the provisioning of resources becomes simple, automated, and repeatable from day 1. You can automate time-consuming IT tasks and drive a collaborative culture to support DevOps initiatives.</p><p name="b460" id="b460" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the addition of more than 60 new modules to the Ansible library, NetApp delivers the most robust integration with Ansible of any storage vendor on the market. With this extensive library of modules, Ansible users can easily develop and deploy playbooks to automate storage tasks without needing to learn the nuances of the specific NetApp product.</p><p name="8696" id="8696" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An Ansible Playbook is basically a definition of what your end environment should look like. On the other hand, an Ansible module takes care of HOW Ansible parses your desired state and relays it to the target environment. As an end-user, you will only need to be concerned with writing Playbooks in YAML.</p><p name="2ac0" id="2ac0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">he modules for the E-Series platform have been part of the official Ansible project for a few months. The ONTAP and Solid Fire modules are now part of the Ansible project as well.</p><figure name="f079" id="f079" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ecoq3E4s8VmJoIjF" data-width="1400" data-height="732" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ecoq3E4s8VmJoIjF"></figure><h3 name="9086" id="9086" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Google Cloud</h3><p name="33f4" id="33f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides scalable infrastructure and solutions to meet the needs of your organization. GCP offers on-demand instances, software-defined networking, storage and databases, and big data solutions and they’re all available at your fingertips. GCP enables your applications to take advantage of Google’s significant infrastructure, utilizing their best-of-breed technology and innovation, and only pay for what you need when you need it .Ansible, by Red Hat, is a simple automation language that can perfectly describe an IT application infrastructure on GCP including virtual machines, disks, network load-balancers, firewall rules and more.</p><p name="b2f5" id="b2f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Ansible/GCP integration gives you everything you need to manage your IT infrastructure. From provisioning instances and auto scaling, custom networks and load balancing, and even managing DNS and cloud storage, it’s all provided. They used Ansible to update satellites in orbit along with other critical infrastructure that serve imagery to interested viewers around the globe by applying a camera-settings hotfix to a satellite orbiting Earth by spinning up a Google Compute Engine instance, testing the latest satellite image build and pushing the settings to the satellite.</p><p name="e7e1" id="e7e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Testing/Continuous Integration</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2677" id="2677" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Use Ansible to launch instances in any GCP Zone, configure networking setups to accurately simulate real-world scenarios.</li><li name="4563" id="4563" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Deploy your code how you want: private disk images, startup scripts pointing to your own package repository and more all within your native Ansible Playbooks.</li></ul><p name="502c" id="502c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The Ansible open source community is a vibrant, fast-moving place that strives to get things done.

It allows the execution of social media campaigns on a variety of networks from a secure dashboard. Hootsuite is popular among Fortune 1000 companies.</p><p name="e030" id="e030" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main challenge facing Hootsuite was the lack of repeatability. This made automating Hootsuite’s infrastructure a challenge, and Hootsuite were also facing difficulties in application deployment.</p><p name="7213" id="7213" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To resolve this, Hootsuite introduced Ansible core. This allowed Hootsuite to build servers from scratch and enabled repeatability. In the future, Hootsuite plans to implement an Ansible migration of its app deployment and possibly in ad hoc production server management.</p><p name="f944" id="f944" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since performing their Ansible migration, Hootsuite says ops and devs ‘feel safer’. Additionally, Ansible allows developers to repeatedly test server builds on a local level until the team can be sure they work.</p><p name="92b7" id="92b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hootsuite intends to use Ansible in many other ways, and as Beier Cai, Director of Technology, Hootsuite Media Inc., explains, “In the beginning I didn’t realize Ansible is good for orchestration as well but found it out quickly and I really loved it as it beats competitors right there.”</p><figure name="b38d" id="b38d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*S2qN5AAPrb527J7F2_rBCA.png" data-width="1625" data-height="376" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S2qN5AAPrb527J7F2_rBCA.png"></figure><h3 name="2f40" id="2f40" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">AMELCO</h3><p name="219e" id="219e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Amelco is a UK-based company that develops software solutions for the betting industry and financial betting markets. The business was looking for a way to deploy its applications efficiently across its hundreds of different environments, and it also sought to limit downtime. To do this, Amelco performed an Ansible migration to an agentless automation framework. This reduced the complexities it faced with the deployment, operations and the upgrade of applications over a range of contrasting locations, while also using one simplified language.</p><p name="0c82" id="0c82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, by introducing Ansible and Ansible Tower, Amelco has successfully automated its application deployments. Other benefits include reduced complexity and continuous delivery, along with speed solution delivery.</p><p name="8381" id="8381" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Further benefits include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="63e3" id="63e3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Faster time to deployment for its bespoke and modular client solutions, resulting in speedier time to market and higher customer satisfaction</li><li name="656c" id="656c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A simplified and repeatable deployment process, leveraging true multi-tier, multi-step orchestration that minimized the complex dependencies of heterogeneous environments</li></ul><figure name="9062" id="9062" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uNqKH6GG8RRpDHMRZHOQ-w.png" data-width="360" data-height="286" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uNqKH6GG8RRpDHMRZHOQ-w.png"></figure><h3 name="c246" id="c246" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">LIFESUM</h3><p name="fec8" id="fec8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Based in Stockholm, Lifesum is a digital health platform that encourages users to lead a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. Lifesum has proved hugely successful throughout Europe, reaching over 6 million downloads so far. Lifesum’s platform uses a host of applications, in addition to a joint back end API, and it bases its infrastructure on AWS. Lifesum was looking for a simplified yet robust tool to allow configuration management, application deployment, and server provisioning.</p><p name="a6d5" id="a6d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prior to introducing Ansible, Lifesum had used another tool but found provisioning and managing different environments a challenge.</p><p name="543d" id="543d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lifesum started their Ansible migration in 2014. It started implementing Ansible straight away and has used it in several major areas. First, Lifesum used Ansible playbooks “to automatically spin up virtual development machines with Vagrant”.</p><p name="23ab" id="23ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the case study, Michal Gasek, SYSOPS Engineer at Lifesum also notes that Lifesum’s goal, “to ensure that everyone had exactly the same working environment as we deploy our applications regularly. Three months later all our environments, from developer’s laptops to production instances on Amazon, are fully Ansible managed.”</p><p name="ac5f" id="ac5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gasek continues, “We use AWS Auto Scaling and pre-bake Amazon AMI images with Ansible provisioning playbooks. When EC2 instances are launched by Auto Scaling, Ansible, triggered by cloud-init, runs provisioning playbooks, once again ensuring up-to-date configuration changes are applied, and pulling the latest applications versions from repositories. Ansible has helped us to automate, significantly simplify and speed up the process of dynamic resources scaling”.</p><p name="2650" id="2650" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gasek adds that Ansible stood out because of its ‘power and simplicity’. Gasek also highlights how Ansible has enabled developers to concentrate on building ‘great product features’, rather than solving common problems like inconsistencies and misconfiguration.</p><h3 name="31f3" id="31f3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">CONCLUSION:</h3><p name="089e" id="089e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">With today’s demand for automation, consistency and the move towards cloud, companies from all sectors are adopting easy-to-use tools that enable them to achieve these goals and overcome complexities. These three success stories show how an Ansible migration is the ideal solution for automating organisation’s modern technology challenges, while also performing an essential role in app deployment and improving responsiveness.</p></div></div></section>
