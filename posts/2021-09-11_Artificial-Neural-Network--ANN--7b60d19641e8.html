The concept of the artificial neural network was inspired by human biology and the way neurons of the human brain function together to understand inputs from human senses.</p><p name="4ded" id="4ded" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neural networks are just one of many tools and approaches used in machine learning algorithms. The neural network itself may be used as a piece in many different machine learning algorithms to process complex data inputs into a space that computers can understand.</p><p name="dd5a" id="dd5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neural networks are being applied to many real-life problems today, including speech and image recognition, spam email filtering, finance, and medical diagnosis, to name a few.</p><h3 name="b6f4" id="b6f4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why Do We Use Neural Networks?</h3><p name="e0bc" id="e0bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Neural networks’ human-like attributes and ability to complete tasks in infinite permutations and combinations make them uniquely suited to today’s big data-based applications. Because neural networks also have the unique capacity (known as<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> fuzzy logic</em>) to make sense of ambiguous, contradictory, or incomplete data, they are able to use controlled processes when no exact models are available.</p><p name="2331" id="2331" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to a report published by Statista, in 2017, global data volumes reached close to 100,000 petabytes (i.e., one million gigabytes) per month; they are forecasted to reach 232,655 petabytes by 2021. With businesses, individuals, and devices generating vast amounts of information, all of that big data is valuable, and neural networks can make sense of it.</p><h3 name="eb47" id="eb47" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Why are Neural Networks Important?</h3><p name="6d67" id="6d67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Neural networks are also ideally suited to help people solve complex problems in real-life situations. They can learn and model the relationships between inputs and outputs that are nonlinear and complex &amp; make generalizations and inferences. It also reveal hidden relationships, patterns and predictions. And model highly volatile data (such as financial time series data) and variances needed to predict rare events (such as fraud detection). As a result, neural networks can improve decision processes in areas such as:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f21a" id="f21a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Credit card and Medicare fraud detection.</li><li name="e845" id="e845" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Optimization of logistics for transportation networks.</li><li name="9540" id="9540" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Character and voice recognition, also known as natural language processing.</li><li name="b0ea" id="b0ea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Medical and disease diagnosis.</li><li name="ac9d" id="ac9d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Targeted marketing.</li><li name="9a9b" id="9a9b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Financial predictions for stock prices, currency, options, futures, bankruptcy and bond ratings.</li><li name="da12" id="da12" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Robotic control systems.</li><li name="3bb3" id="3bb3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Electrical load and energy demand forecasting.</li><li name="4a4d" id="4a4d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Process and quality control.</li><li name="6a91" id="6a91" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Chemical compound identification.</li><li name="733e" id="733e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Ecosystem evaluation.</li><li name="d58b" id="d58b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Computer vision to interpret raw photos and videos (for example, in medical imaging and robotics and facial recognition).</li></ul><h3 name="4d41" id="4d41" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Types of Neural Networks</h3><p name="0f43" id="0f43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There are different kinds of deep neural networks and each has advantages and disadvantages, depending upon the use. Examples include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ec77" id="ec77" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) contain five types of layers: input, convolution, pooling, fully connected and output. Each layer has a specific purpose, like summarizing, connecting or activating. Convolutional neural networks have popularized image classification and object detection. However, CNNs have also been applied to other areas, such as natural language processing and forecasting.</li><li name="3791" id="3791" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) use sequential information such as time-stamped data from a sensor device or a spoken sentence, composed of a sequence of terms. Unlike traditional neural networks, all inputs to a recurrent neural network are not independent of each other, and the output for each element depends on the computations of its preceding elements. RNNs are used in fore­casting and time series applications, sentiment analysis and other text applications.</li><li name="00a8" id="00a8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Feedforward neural networks, in which each perceptron in one layer is connected to every perceptron from the next layer. Information is fed forward from one layer to the next in the forward direction only. There are no feedback loops.</li><li name="faaa" id="faaa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Autoencoder neural networks are used to create abstractions called encoders, created from a given set of inputs. Although similar to more traditional neural networks, autoencoders seek to model the inputs themselves, and therefore the method is considered unsupervised. The premise of autoencoders is to desensitize the irrelevant and sensitize the relevant. As layers are added, further abstractions are formulated at higher layers (layers closest to the point at which a decoder layer is introduced). These abstractions can then be used by linear or nonlinear classifiers.</li></ul><figure name="9d11" id="9d11" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*y9_vxrRCkFbu0FCHxjYGWQ.png" data-width="1316" data-height="878" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*y9_vxrRCkFbu0FCHxjYGWQ.png"></figure><h3 name="67dd" id="67dd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">How do Neural Networks work?</h3><p name="2b3c" id="2b3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A neural network is a bundle of neurons connected by synapses. Talking about the artificial one, the role of neurons are played by the units that perform calculations. Each of these “neurons”:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="cc07" id="cc07" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">receives data from the input layer;</li><li name="baff" id="baff" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">processes it performing simple calculations with it;</li><li name="024d" id="024d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">and then transmits it to another “neuron”.</li></ul><p name="45c7" id="45c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Usually, neural networks consist of three types of neurons:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="c3a5" id="c3a5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">input layer</li><li name="5dd9" id="5dd9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">output layer</li><li name="2547" id="2547" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">hidden layer</li></ul><p name="bed3" id="bed3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Only single layer neural networks make an exception. They don’t have hidden neurons.</p><p name="65b3" id="65b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The synapses are responsible for connecting neurons with each other. Each neuron has got multiple outcoming synapses that attenuate or amplify the signal. This makes it possible for the neurons to work in the same way, but to show the different results depending on a certain situation.</p><p name="2680" id="2680" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, neurons are capable of changing their characteristics over a period of time.</p><p name="3bbe" id="3bbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, a typical neural network works like this:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5ea5" id="5ea5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">it receives certain data through the input layer of neurons,</li><li name="1b83" id="1b83" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">the data is processed by the neurons and passed to the next layer with the help of synapses each of which has its own coefficient,</li><li name="bec3" id="bec3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">the next layer of neurons receive the information that is the sum of all of all data for neural networks, which are multiplied by the weight coefficients (each by its own),</li><li name="573a" id="573a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">the resulting value is substituted into the activation function, resulting in the formation of output information,</li><li name="d5d5" id="d5d5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">information is passed on until it reaches the final exit.</li></ul><h3 name="11f3" id="11f3" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Advantages And Disadvantages of Neural Networks</h3><h4 name="029f" id="029f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Advantages of Neural Networks</h4><p name="6234" id="6234" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Storing information on the entire network :</strong> Information such as in traditional programming is stored on the entire network, not on a database. The disappearance of a few pieces of information in one place does not prevent the network from functioning.</p><p name="f428" id="f428" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ability to work with incomplete knowledge :</strong> After ANN training, the data may produce output even with incomplete information. The loss of performance here depends on the importance of the missing information.</p><p name="8b25" id="8b25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Having fault tolerance:</strong> Corruption of one or more cells of ANN does not prevent it from generating output. This feature makes the networks fault tolerant.</p><p name="3ee6" id="3ee6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Having a distributed memory:</strong> In order for ANN to be able to learn, it is necessary to determine the examples and to teach the network according to the desired output by showing these examples to the network. The network’s success is directly proportional to the selected instances, and if the event can not be shown to the network in all its aspects, the network can produce false output</p><p name="539f" id="539f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Gradual corruption: </strong>A network slows over time and undergoes relative degradation. The network problem does not immediately corrode immediately.</p><p name="5b9c" id="5b9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ability to make machine learning:</strong> Artificial neural networks learn events and make decisions by commenting on similar events.</p><p name="2de6" id="2de6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Parallel processing capability:</strong> Artificial neural networks have numerical strength that can perform more than one job at the same time.</p><h4 name="3ac7" id="3ac7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Disadvantages of Neural Networks</h4><p name="0aa3" id="0aa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hardware dependence:</strong> Artificial neural networks require processors with parallel processing power, in accordance with their structure. For this reason, the realization of the equipment is dependent.</p><p name="8160" id="8160" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Unexplained behavior of the network:</strong> This is the most important problem of ANN. When ANN produces a probing solution, it does not give a clue as to why and how. This reduces trust in the network.</p><p name="0cf6" id="0cf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Determination of proper network structure:</strong> There is no specific rule for determining the structure of artificial neural networks. Appropriate network structure is achieved through experience and trial and error.</p><p name="e967" id="e967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Difficulty of showing the problem to the network:</strong> ANNs can work with numerical information. Problems have to be translated into numerical values before being introduced to ANN. The display mechanism to be determined here will directly influence the performance of the network . This depends on the user’s ability.</p><p name="18de" id="18de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The duration of the network is unknown: </strong>The network is reduced to a certain value of the error on the sample means that the training has been completed. This value does not give us optimum results.</p><p name="4fbd" id="4fbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Science artificial neural networks that have stepped into the world in the mid-20th century are rapidly developing. In our present day, we have examined the advantages of artificial neural networks and the problems encountered in the course of their use. It should not be forgotten that the disadvantages of ANN networks, which are a developing science branch, are eliminated one by one and their advantages are increasing day by day. This means that artificial neural networks will become an indispensable part of our lives increasingly important.</p><h3 name="b40b" id="b40b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Various Applications

The algorithm works by testing each possible state of the input attribute against each possible state of the predictable attribute, and calculating probabilities for each combination based on the training data. You can use these probabilities for both classification or regression tasks, to predict an outcome based on some input attributes. A neural network can also be used for association analysis.</p><p name="b241" id="b241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you create a mining model using the Microsoft Neural Network algorithm, you can include multiple outputs, and the algorithm will create multiple networks. The number of networks contained in a single mining model contains depends on the number of states (or attribute values) in the input columns, as well as the number of predictable columns that the mining model uses and the number of states in those columns.</p><h4 name="fb74" id="fb74" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Example</h4><p name="9a2b" id="9a2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Microsoft Neural Network algorithm is useful for analyzing complex input data, such as from a manufacturing or commercial process, or business problems for which a significant quantity of training data is available but for which rules cannot be easily derived by using other algorithms.</p><p name="aff8" id="aff8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suggested scenarios for using the Microsoft Neural Network algorithm include the following:</p><p name="8906" id="8906" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Marketing and promotion analysis, such as measuring the success of a direct mail promotion or a radio advertising campaign</p><p name="a935" id="a935" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Predicting stock movement, currency fluctuation, or other highly fluid financial information from historical data</p><p name="e2e1" id="e2e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Analyzing manufacturing and industrial processes</p><p name="011a" id="011a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Text mining</p><p name="beed" id="beed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Any prediction model that analyzes complex relationships between many inputs and relatively fewer outputs</p><h4 name="b7ff" id="b7ff" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">How the Algorithm Works</h4><p name="f9e2" id="f9e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Microsoft Neural Network algorithm creates a network that is composed of up to three layers of nodes (sometimes called neurons). These layers are the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer.</p><p name="0c3d" id="0c3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Input layer: Input nodes define all the input attribute values for the data mining model, and their probabilities.</p><p name="4f7c" id="4f7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hidden layer: Hidden nodes receive inputs from input nodes and provide outputs to output nodes. The hidden layer is where the various probabilities of the inputs are assigned weights. A weight describes the relevance or importance of a particular input to the hidden node. The greater the weight that is assigned to an input, the more important the value of that input is. Weights can be negative, which means that the input can inhibit, rather than favor, a specific result.</p><p name="b227" id="b227" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Output layer: Output nodes represent predictable attribute values for the data mining model.</p><p name="f380" id="f380" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a detailed explanation of how the input, hidden, and output layers are constructed and scored, see Microsoft Neural Network Algorithm Technical Reference.</p><h4 name="ecc4" id="ecc4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Data Required for Neural Network Models</h4><p name="af91" id="af91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A neural network model must contain a key column, one or more input columns, and one or more predictable columns.</p><p name="c99c" id="c99c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data mining models that use the Microsoft Neural Network algorithm are heavily influenced by the values that you specify for the parameters that are available to the algorithm. The parameters define how data is sampled, how data is distributed or expected to be distributed in each column, and when feature selection is invoked to limit the values that are used in the final model.</p><p name="3ca2" id="3ca2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For more information about setting parameters to customize model behavior, see Microsoft Neural Network Algorithm Technical Reference.</p><h4 name="49d3" id="49d3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Viewing a Neural Network Model</h4><p name="d14b" id="d14b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To work with the data and see how the model correlates inputs with outputs, you can use the Microsoft Neural Network Viewer. With this custom viewer, you can filter on input attributes and their values, and see graphs that show how they affect the outputs. Tooltips in the viewer show the probability and lift associated with each pair of input and output values. For more information, see Browse a Model Using the Microsoft Neural Network Viewer.</p><p name="f74a" id="f74a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The easiest way to explore the structure of the model is to use the Microsoft Generic Content Tree Viewer. You can view the inputs, outputs, and networks created by the model, and click on any node to expand it and see statistics related to the input, output, or hidden layer nodes.

A neural network model supports regression, association, and classification analysis, Therefore, the meaning of each prediction might be different. You can also query the model itself, to review the correlations that were found and retrieve related statistics.

When working on a specific project, developers constantly resort to external sources of information to find solutions or code snippets to a given problem. However, the search resolution is mostly based on metadata and not in the information provided by the code itself. For instance, if a developer posts a code snippet to StackOverflow, it will typically include a description and tags that help to index it for future searches. This approach relies on the accuracy of that metadata in order to render accurate search results, but it also misses information that can be inferred directly from the code. To address this limitation, a team from Facebook AI Research (FAIR) has been working on an approach to use natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) to infer search-relevant information directly from the source code text.</p><p name="f20d" id="f20d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first materialization of the FAIR team efforts is a tool called Neural Code Search (NCS) which accepts a natural language query and returns results inferred directly from the code corpus. The techniques behind NCS were summarized in two research papers recently published:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="516b" id="516b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3211353&amp;fbclid=IwAR3qdp2vDXwBuZb7uw2vR1op7SPngnRr0R6l3pxHrvqWH_0Unj0UXtTYpKA" data-href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3211353&amp;fbclid=IwAR3qdp2vDXwBuZb7uw2vR1op7SPngnRr0R6l3pxHrvqWH_0Unj0UXtTYpKA" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">NCS</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">: </strong>This paper describes a technique that uses an unsupervised model that combines NLP and IR techniques.</li><li name="acdf" id="acdf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03813.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3_9ejBpho2yNLfMKVCp5rZ58gAD63T_peTg3RQh8tIRLZkYwH9SquLQI8" data-href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03813.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3_9ejBpho2yNLfMKVCp5rZ58gAD63T_peTg3RQh8tIRLZkYwH9SquLQI8" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">UNIF</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">: </strong>This paper proposes an extension of NCS that uses a supervised neural network model to improve performance when good supervision data is available for training.</li></ul><p name="633a" id="633a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The principles behind both techniques, NCS and UNIF, is relatively similar. Both methods rely on vector representations of code snippets, which can be used to train a model such as semantically similar code snippets, and queries are close together in the vector space. This technique is able to answer natural language queries directly using the code snippets corpus without relying on external metadata. Although both techniques (NCS, UNIF) are relatively similar, UNIF extends NCS with a supervised model to create even more accurate answers to NLP queries.</p><figure name="617b" id="617b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JuVCTNr0RRTAd8WIcgC2lQ.png" data-width="856" data-height="268" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JuVCTNr0RRTAd8WIcgC2lQ.png"></figure><h4 name="d09f" id="d09f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">NVIDIA</h4><p name="feab" id="feab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">NIVIDA used a Neural network to develop their one SDK name is TensorRT. it is an SDK for high-performance deep learning inference.
